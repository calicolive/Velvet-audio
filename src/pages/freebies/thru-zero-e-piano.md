## The Story

I wanted to see if I could recreate an E-Piano using my modular synth.

E-Pianos like the Rhodes are made up of two main sounds: The Tine and the Tonebar.

The Tine is the bell like sound that is heard at the beginning of each note and the Tonebar is the sustained sound.

In order to recreate the Tine, I had to use the frequency modulation as it is perfect for bell like sounds but here comes the first issue, analog oscillators and FM do not track well. The solution was to use my SSF Zero Point Oscillator that does Through Zero FM. This allowed me to get crazy with FM without the pitch drifting. If you are interested in Through Zero FM I recommend you read this: <https://learningmodular.com/understanding-the-differences-between-exponential-linear-and-through-zero-fm/>

For the Tonebar part I used my Deckards Voice and filtered it down. Blending these two sounds together gave me the sound I was looking for. Lastly, I ran it through my Analog Heat for a little bit more saturation and then I recorded 88 keys and looped them for infinite sustain.

For the GUI I wanted to recreate a LABS style GUI. I am a big fan of their Neumorphic and minimal design and I think I was able to get pretty close.

Anyway enough rambling here. I hope you like the instrument!
