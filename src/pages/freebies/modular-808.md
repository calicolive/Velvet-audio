I created an 808 bass on my modular synth using my analog oscillators and envelopes!

You can shape the length 808 with the release knob and use the glide knob to glide between the notes. The samples are also looped perfectly for infinite sustain!

I added an Attack knob incase you want to layer it with an actual kick and need the 808 to fade in a bit.

The 808 library includes two presets, a smooth version and a saturated version.

**How to use:**

- Please download the free Decent Sampler here: <https://www.decentsamples.com/product/decent-sampler-plugin/>
- Then click the Modular 808.dslibrary file and this will install the instrument

Enjoy!
