Your website is the bread and butter of your brand, so tracking its performance can feel like a full-time job. (*“Sorry, I can’t go out tonight. I have to check if my site’s still up.”*)

Not only do you need to be aware of issues with your service so you can address them in time, but you also have to let customers know about maintenance updates.

If only there was a tool that could monitor your website, server, and apps 24/7 and send timely performance updates to all your stakeholders.

#### TL;DR

* Monitor the performance of websites and apps, and get notified of changes in real time via phone, SMS, email, or other channels
* Check multiple monitors on one dashboard and provide clear incident communication with customizable status pages
